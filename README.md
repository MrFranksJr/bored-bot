# BoredBot â€“ playing with the BoredAPI

## Overview

**Live version [here](https://bored-botz.netlify.app)**

BoredBot is an introductory app, part of Module 8 of the Front-Developer Career Path over at [scrimba.com](https://scrimba.com).

With this app, we explore the FetchAPI interface and interact with the BoredAPI in order to find us something nice to do.

Below are the topics we covered in this module:

All and all a fairly simple app, just to take my first steps into working with APIs.

### Some extra's
I did add a couple of extra's in this app:
* The logo was generated with Dall E, because why not :)
* The button relies on an array to feed the user a couple of extra strings of text when they press it.
